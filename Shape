Program Title: Inheritance with Shape-Circle-Rectangle

Aim: To implement inheritance using a base class Shape and derived clsses Circle and Rectangle.

Algorithm:

1. Create base class Shape.

2. Add method area() in Shape.

3. Create derived classes Circle and Rectangle.

4. Override area() in both.

5. Instantiate objects and call respective methods.

Test Cases:

TCI: Circle with radius 5→ Area = 78.5

TC2: Rectangle 10x5→ Area = 50

TC3: Shape area() not overridden → Output: Default area

TC4: Zero radius circle Output: Area = 0

TC5: Rectangle with width 0→Area = 0
